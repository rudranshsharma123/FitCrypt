## Inspiration
Instagram is a very popular application for Image sharing and thus we have seen a lot of people over there sharing all sorts of information. There is a fully-fledged Fitness community there however, it is controlled on Facebook's (or now Meta's) whim and has no option of earning real money through their posts/tips. Not to mention the scammers, "Fake Gurus", and "Clout Chasers" are always lurking in the space to fish any clueless fitness newbie. So, to allow content creators to directly earn money from their posts and having a decentralized system I created the FitCrypt. Moreover, everyone will be needed to pay the Gas money to post on this platform hence, it will deter scammers and all the Fakes fitness preachers from posting on this platform!

## What it does
It is a Decentralised, image-sharing app in which you can share your fitness images, workout regimes, and in general, any tips related to improving the fitness of the people and get tipped from anyone seeing your Images!!

## How I built it
I built the backend in the Solidity programming language and used the Truffle Suite for Testing and deploying the application on a local blockchain which was spun up using Ganache (both GUI and CLU) and used MetaMask extension on the browser to inject web3 into the browser. The frontend was written in React and used Bootstrap, and Vanilla CSS to have a few effects. The images are stored on the IPFS Storage server (or InterPlanetary File System).

## Challenges I ran into
Where do I even begin on this one. This one is by far the most ambitious project I have ever written. Why? Because before this project I had very small knowledge of React, HTML, CSS,  JS and no knowledge of Solidity and developing for Etherium blockchain. So, I had to put on very very long hours late sleepless night to learn and develop at the same time. React was not playing nicely with bootstrap until I saw that I was missing one simple import statement. IPFS or InterPlanetary File System was just not ready to work (the latest version) so I had to dig around to find a way with an older version then finding a way to see the images was also a time consuming job to find the right API endpooints. Not to mention since I had near to no knowledge of  React getting everything to work like they should was a very very difficult task (in my opinion) 

## Accomplishments that I am proud of
The fact that everything works like I had wanted and I did manage to make a full stack dApp in under 48 hours is something I am very proud of (considering I had near to no knowledge of the Tech Stack)

## What I learned
I learned a lot about Blockchain, writing smart contracts, Solidity programming language, React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and IPFS. 

## What's next for FitCrypt
I had an even grandiose plan for the whole app like having events and an image detection system but I ran out of time. I am planning to extend this project for next week and make it look much better.
